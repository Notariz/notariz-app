# notariz-app

This is Notariz front-end React application repository.

# Test it!

Notariz is live at https://notariz.netlify.app/ 
Please think of switching your wallet to the dev net! 

# Roadmap

## Short-term

### Staking

Notariz should allow its users to stake their deposits. Implementing this feature would make it more profitable to hold assets in a deed account.

### Vesting

Notariz should allow its users to split their emergency transfers across time, with a fixed number of payments for each user.

## Mid-term

### SPL tokens compliance

Notariz should allow its users to send every kind of SPL tokens, not solely native SOL.

## Long-term

### Wallet browser extension

Notariz should allow its users to define their lists and interact with their deed accounts directly through a dedicated wallet extension.
