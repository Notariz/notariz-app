# notariz-app

This is Notariz front-end React application repository.

# Test it!

Notariz is live at https://notariz.netlify.app/ 
Please think of switching your wallet to the dev net! 

# Roadmap

In spite of Notariz being fully functional, we would like to add the following features in the future:

## Staking

Notariz should allow its users to stake their deposits. Implementing this feature would make it more profitable to hold assets in a deed account.

## Vesting

Notariz should allow its users to split their emergency transfers across time, with a fixed number of payments for each user.
